## Reflection

We strive to work in a fully professional manner. We hold regular meetings every Tuesday and Thursday, where we discuss our tasks and project progress. Our meetings usually start with brainstorming sessions, and after reviewing and accepting the ideas, we decided to create a website called HelpConnect.

The goal of this website is to provide a platform where anyone can offer or request help. We believe there is a significant gap in the Finnish community that this kind of service can fill.

In front of the development group, we designed a prototype using Figma, and now we have moved into the real project phase. The tasks have been divided among team members, and we have started working on the project collaboratively.

This Figma prototype represents the initial design of the HelpConnect website : https://www.figma.com/make/qMKm053W5kn1JNJOwQ51h0/Help-App?t=rL7oag2dGuk2CF0d-1


### Challenges Faced:

From the very beginning of our work, we faced many challenges, starting from choosing the right idea to deciding how to proceed with the project. At times, the meeting environment became quite intense, but our approach was always to keep moving forward and solve the issues step by step.

Our biggest challenge so far has been selecting the right idea, because without a prototype, it is difficult to clearly understand and visualize an idea. However, we managed to overcome this challenge and continue our work successfully.

### What Went Well and Lessons Learned:

One of the best aspects of our group is that no one has only basic knowledge, and most of the tasks are well understood by the team members. So far, the collaboration has been smooth and without major challenges.

For me personally, this project has been a valuable learning experience. I learned how to continue developing my idea even when there was disagreement, because we were able to convince others by clearly explaining and justifying our ideas.

In my opinion, this website has the potential to be expanded into a mobile application in the future. I hope to reach that stage and be involved in developing it as well.

- Key Learning:

During this week, I learned several new concepts and strategies that significantly contributed to my understanding and personal growth. One of the most important lessons was how to develop and defend an idea within a team, even when there were different opinions. I learned that clear explanation and logical reasoning can help others better understand and accept an idea.

I also gained experience in collaborative project work, especially in task distribution and team communication. Working with a prototype helped me understand how abstract ideas can be transformed into something more concrete and easier to discuss.

Additionally, I improved my problem-solving skills by learning how to stay focused and continue working despite challenges or intense discussions during meetings. Overall, this week helped me grow both technically and professionally.

### Coping Strategies:


- Academic Progress:

This week, although I did not have complete confidence in all the course materials and exercises at the beginning, I made sure to complete all my assignments on time. Working through the tasks helped me better understand the concepts and identify the areas where I need more practice.

I have especially enjoyed learning React, as it has made building user interfaces more engaging and meaningful for me. In addition, I have developed a strong interest in design using Tailwind CSS, which has helped me improve both my technical skills and my sense of visual layout.

Overall, even though there are still areas where I need to deepen my understanding, I feel that I am making steady progress and becoming more confident through practice and hands-on learning.

- Soft Skills Development:

During this week, my soft skills played an important role in my progress. Communication helped me clearly express my ideas and explain my thoughts to my teammates, especially during discussions and brainstorming sessions. This made collaboration smoother and more effective.

Working in a team also strengthened my collaboration skills, as I learned how to listen to different opinions, give feedback, and work toward a shared goal. Even when disagreements occurred, problem-solving skills helped me stay calm, analyze the situation, and find practical solutions.

Overall, these soft skills helped me work more confidently within the team, overcome challenges, and continue making progress throughout the week.

### Project Management:

Agile project management principles positively influenced my work and collaboration this week. Since I am already familiar with agile methods and enjoy using them, regular meetings and continuous feedback helped keep the team aligned. Breaking tasks into smaller steps made the project more manageable and improved overall collaboration and productivity.

### Final Thoughts:
Looking back on this week's experiences, I’m proud of my efforts in the Web Course and the Project Course. I know that as we move forward toward completing the project, we will face more challenges. However, I am already familiar with group work and its challenges, and I try to see every challenge as a learning opportunity. I focus on learning from these experiences and continuing to move forward with motivation and confidence.

### Next Steps:

For the upcoming week, our team has been divided into two groups: frontend and backend, and we have officially started working on our tasks. Each task is clearly defined with detailed descriptions in Trello, and we plan to move forward based on those task lists.

My main focus will be on completing my assigned tasks according to the plan and addressing any challenges during our weekly meetings. By following our workflow and collaborating closely with the team, I aim to make steady progress and contribute effectively to the project
