## Peer assessment

I did monday pair programing with Armin and it was great teamworking . first practic I shared my screen and I put it github sesend one armin shared and I learend alot.

Minoo (4) – UI/UX Designer & Frontend Developer
Despite personal challenges, including my son being ill, I completed my tasks professionally. I used available time while he was resting or playing to practice and work on my responsibilities. I am highly committed to my work and have a strong passion for design, which motivated me to work late hours to ensure everything was completed on time.
Our instructor, Sami, really liked the website prototype I created together with Markus—especially the Web Help Connect idea, which was also my concept. This positive feedback increased my confidence and motivation for the following week.

Markus (4) – Project Manager & Frontend Developer
Markus performed very well in his role as Project Owner. For example, when Maria initially disagreed with an idea—despite already having three positive votes—Markus successfully encouraged her to collaborate and move forward with the team. Without his support and leadership, progress would have been much more difficult.

Mike (4) – Backend Developer
Mike worked as a backend developer and has been doing a great job so far. He was responsible for managing the backlog and consistently contributed to the technical development of the project.

Maria (4) – Backend Developer & Scrum Master (Weeks 2 & 3)
Maria was precise and effective in her role as Scrum Master. At times, she shared differing opinions—for instance, she preferred defining all website features from the beginning, while the team believed creating a prototype first was essential. We had constructive discussions, and she agreed to wait for the prototype. Once it was completed, she was very pleased with the result.

## Reflection

Weeks 2 and 3 were intense, challenging, and deeply meaningful for me. In Week 2, we focused on building the prototype and shaping the project storyline. In Week 3, with the presentation deadline approaching, our attention shifted to documentation, preparation, and final refinements. Throughout this time, every team member stayed engaged and committed, which created a strong sense of responsibility and trust within the group.

Despite personal and technical challenges, I remained dedicated to my work. Missing a GitHub repo and having to start over was frustrating, but it pushed me to be more patient and determined. When my son became unwell and I couldn’t attend the online class, I felt discouraged—but I didn’t give up. I watched the recorded sessions, worked late into the night, and completed my homework + prototype with care and focus. Uploading the final work felt like a personal achievement as much as a team contribution.

Our Friday presentation was a proud moment for all of us. Knowing that we worked together until 5 a.m. to meet the deadline made the success even more meaningful. Sami’s positive feedback on our teamwork and professionalism confirmed that our effort, resilience, and collaboration truly paid off. This experience reminded me that teamwork is at its best when it is built on support, learning, and shared determination even in the most challenging moments.

### Challenges Faced:

This week came with several challenges, mainly related to time management and personal responsibilities. With a tight deadline for the first presentation, balancing teamwork, individual tasks, and family commitments was demanding. I missed one GitHub practice session and had to restart the exercise, which required extra effort to review materials and watch tutorial videos to avoid repeating mistakes.
Additionally, my son was ill, and I was unable to attend one of the online classes. Despite this, I stayed committed by watching the recorded sessions and working late at night to complete my prototype on time. These challenges pushed me to be more disciplined, adaptable, and persistent, ultimately helping me grow both technically and professionally.

### What Went Well and Lessons Learned:

I learned that GitHub requires a lot of attention, and I need to invest more time in understanding it properly. I also realized the importance of balancing my studies, practice, and family responsibilities more effectively.

- Key Learning:

This week, I learned that working with GitHub requires careful attention and consistent practice, and that I need to deepen my understanding of it further. I also learned the importance of balancing my studies, hands-on practice, and family responsibilities in order to stay productive and motivated.

### Coping Strategies:

- Academic Progress:

This week, my academic progress was strong. We received a very good grade for our project, which reflected the quality of our teamwork and professionalism. I also completed all required exercises, even during times when I was absent, and stayed fully engaged with the course material. Overall, I feel that I performed well and made steady improvement throughout the week.

- Soft Skills Development:

This week, I learned how to move my work forward even when receiving negative feedback. I stayed focused on the team’s goals and continued putting in my best effort, even when I felt discouraged. This helped me contribute positively to the group and supported both my personal growth and the team’s progress.

### Project Management:

Being familiar with agile teamwork and project management positively influenced my approach this week. Agile principles helped our team work more efficiently, address challenges during our regular weekly meetings (on Tuesday and Thursday), and continuously improve our process. Each meeting focused not only on progress but also on identifying ways to collaborate better and deliver higher-quality results.

### Final Thoughts:

This week was one of the most challenging yet rewarding experiences of my journey so far. Balancing personal responsibilities with academic and team commitments pushed me beyond my comfort zone, but it also showed me my own strength and resilience. Working within a supportive and motivated team reminded me that growth happens through collaboration, perseverance, and openness to learning. This experience deepened my passion for my work and strengthened my determination to continue improving, learning, and contributing at an even higher level

### Next Steps:

In Week 3, our focus will be on finalizing the website as much as possible. We will hold daily meetings to ensure steady progress and alignment within the team. I will take on the role of Scrum Master during Week 3 and possibly Week 4, which I see as both a challenge and a valuable learning opportunity.
Balancing this responsibility alongside my role as a mother of a active and lovely boy and as a committed student will require strong organization and discipline. However, I am determined to work even harder, face upcoming challenges with resilience, and stay focused on achieving my goals.
