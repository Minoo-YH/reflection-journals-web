## Reflection

In weeks 4 and 5, I officially started my role as a Scrum Master. My very first Scrum Master session came with a serious challenge. Maria pointed out that the front-end code was causing conflicts, and she had a disagreement with Markus that escalated to the point where Markus deleted the main page repository. This made me really angry because all of my commits were there.

At the same time, I am still struggling to balance being a mother and studying. Sometimes I have to stay up late into the night to study and complete my assignments, which can be very exhausting.

One thing that really caught my attention this week was Gemini as an AI tool. It was a very interesting topic, and it was my first time being introduced to it. I definitely want to learn more about it.

Our group project is progressing well, and at the moment I am working on the messaging part of the project.

### Challenges Faced:
The main challenges I encountered this week were related to team conflicts, time management, and balancing multiple responsibilities. As a Scrum Master, I faced my first serious conflict within the team, which required me to stay calm, mediate between team members, and handle the situation professionally despite feeling personally affected by the loss of my commits.

In addition, managing my time has been challenging as I am balancing my role as a mother with my studies. There were several days when I had to work late at night to keep up with assignments and project tasks, which affected my energy and focus.

From a technical perspective, understanding new tools and concepts such as AI technologies also required extra time and effort, as I am still in the learning process

### What Went Well and Lessons Learned:

This week had several positive outcomes despite the challenges. I am actively trying to improve my skills and grow both technically and professionally. Our group project is progressing well, and the collaboration within the team has been productive overall.

On the front-end side, I am intentionally using cleaner code, fewer lines, and the most up-to-date approaches that I am learning in class. I am making an effort to write more professional, maintainable code and to truly understand the patterns and techniques I use, rather than just applying them superficially.

One of the most valuable lessons I learned this week is the importance of continuous learning and adaptability. Even when facing challenges, staying committed to improving my skills and contributing to the team leads to positive results

- Key Learning:

This week, I gained a better understanding of the Scrum Master role, especially in supporting the team and handling challenges. I also learned more modern front-end techniques and focused on writing cleaner, more professional code using best practices.

In addition, I was introduced to AI tools such as Gemini, which increased my interest in learning more about how AI can support development. Overall, these experiences helped me grow both technically and professionally.

### Coping Strategies:


- Academic Progress:

This week, I completed all assigned tasks and participated fully in pair programming. For the pair programming activity, I chose option A, which required less time but was more challenging. I enjoyed this challenge and found it helpful for improving my problem-solving skills.

In the group project, I worked on the messaging part and made steady progress. Overall, I feel positive about my academic progress this week and confident in my continued improvement.

- Soft Skills Development:

This week, my soft skills were especially important in my role as a Scrum Master. Effective communication helped me facilitate discussions, clarify misunderstandings, and support team members during challenges. Collaboration allowed me to encourage teamwork and keep the group focused on shared goals.

I also used problem-solving skills to stay calm during conflicts and help the team move forward in a constructive way. These soft skills helped me grow in my Scrum Master role and contribute positively to the team’s progress
### Project Management:

This week, agile project management principles influenced how we organized our work and collaborated as a team. We followed an agile approach by breaking tasks into smaller parts and focusing on continuous progress. We also used WorkPerfect to manage tasks, track responsibilities, and stay aligned as a team.

Agile practices helped improve communication, transparency, and flexibility, allowing us to adapt quickly and work more efficiently together
### Final Thoughts:

Looking back on this week’s experiences, I am proud of my efforts in the Web Course and the Project Course. Each challenge became an opportunity to learn and grow, and I am motivated to continue developing my skills and expanding my knowledge.
### Next Steps:

For the upcoming week, my main goal is to finish my remaining messaging task. After the group Scrum Master session on Tuesday, I plan to take on additional responsibilities and support other tasks within the team.

I also intend to stay focused on improving my time management and continuing to develop my technical and Scrum Master skills
