### Challenges Faced:

During the week 4 and 5, my main challenge was balancing my development tasks with my responsibilities as the Scrum Master. Managing the team’s planning, coordinating group work, and supporting our team practices alongside my own deliverables was demanding. However, I was able to organize my time and handle both effectively. For the two weeks that I served as Scrum Master, I planned the team’s work carefully to make sure everything stayed on track and we met our goals.
### What Went Well and Lessons Learned:
This week, I learned that it’s better to create a pull request for each task as I complete it. That way, I can get feedback early, keep my work organized, and easily update or improve it later.

- Key Learning:

This week, I became more familiar with the messaging feature and how we can integrate it both inside and outside the dashboard. I also learned what we need to do to keep React working smoothly—especially around structuring components and managing updates efficiently. It was an interesting and valuable topic for me.

- Online Resources:

I didn’t use any online resources this week, as my time was focused on preparing for Friday’s presentation and handling Scrum Master responsibilities.

### Coping Strategies:


- Academic Progress:

Academic Progress (Week 5):
This week, I completed all of my assigned tasks and stayed on track with the project work. I also actively participated in group activities and contributed to the team’s progress.

Soft Skills Development:
My communication and collaboration skills helped me stay engaged with the team, especially during group work and coordination. One challenge I faced was during pair programming with a new teammate. We started working together at 13:30, but as usual I had to leave at 15:00 to pick up my son. My pair seemed disappointed, and I felt nervous and a bit stressed because it seemed like my situation as a mother wasn’t fully understood. This experience reminded me of the importance of setting expectations early and communicating my schedule clearly so we can plan pair work more effectively.

### Project Management:

Agile project management principles guided our work well this week. As usual, we discussed problems openly and worked together to find solutions, and this week we also focused on preparing for the presentation. As the Scrum Master, I created the presentation file, asked everyone to update their parts and tasks in Google Drive, and helped the team stay aligned. I also made a video to support the front-end team’s presentation and ensure our message was clear and consistent.

### Final Thoughts:

Looking back on this week’s experiences, I’m proud of my efforts in the Web Course and the Project Course. I worked hard to balance my responsibilities as a Scrum Master, my group work, and my role as a mother—and I believe I managed it successfully. At the same time, I know there is always room to improve, and I’m excited to keep learning and becoming even better.

### Next Steps:

My goals for the upcoming week are to complete the messaging part and create more pull requests more frequently so I can get feedback earlier and keep my work organized.
